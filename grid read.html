                 <h3>editing</h3>
                 <p>I work as a News Editor at <i><a href="https://www.levernews.com/">The Lever</a></i>, alongside a small team of journalists investigating corporate malfeasance and political corruption.</p>
                <h3>communications</h3>
                <p>
<p>In my work at <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/">Irrational Labs</a>, a behavioral design consulting firm, I produced biweekly newsletters, press releases, academic summaries, and all web content, using SEO guidelines, targeted advertising and organic content to promote our workshops, bootcamps and thought leadership. As part of the social media and distribution team at <i><a href=“https://perfectunion.us>More Perfect Union</a></i>, a progressive media organization focused on working people, I helped build our multi-platform presence, designed graphics, pursued external partnerships, maintained our website and reported metrics for company-wide meetings. I’ve written social media copy, blog content, marketing materials, B2B and B2C communication materials, and pursued promotional opportunities for guest posts and podcasts, with an organic public relations approach. Whether working independently or on a team, I’m an excellent communicator and a resourceful thinker, willing to ensure that any final product is exceptional.

                 <h3>fact-checking</h3>
   <p>Widely regarded as one of the best and most rigorous programs for early-career journalists, The Victor S. Navasky Editorial Internship offered a comprehensive immersion in <i><a href=“thenation.com>The Nation's<a/></i> editorial processes – both in print and online – with rigorous training in fact-checking, research, investigative reporting, and web production. I regularly fact-check for <i><a href=“https://theappeal.org/“>The Appeal</a></i>, <i><a href=“https://www.thedriftmag.com/“>The Drift</a></i>, and <i><a href=“https://harpers.org/“>Harper’s</a></i>.</p>
                 <p>
   <h3>research</h3>
   <p>In 2023, I worked as a legal researcher on a project examining how the "deliberate indifference" standard makes it extremely difficult for incarcerated people to vindicate clear violations of the Eighth Amendment. The project, led by correspondents at <i><a href="https://insider.com">Insider</a></i> was funded by a criminal justice reporting grant from the Ira A. Lipman Center for Journalism and Civil and Human Rights at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.</p>
