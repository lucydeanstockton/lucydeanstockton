<p>Excerpt from "Ciproflaxicin and the Severing"</p>

<p>Hostis in Latin means both host and enemy, friend and stranger. In “The Critic As Host,” J. Hillis Miller writes, “The words "host" and "guest" return to the same etymological root: ghos-ti, stranger, guest, host, properly "someone with whom one has reciprocal duties of hospitality” (1977). Miller, a literary critic, uses this framework to explore relationships of reciprocity mediated by thoughts and words, poems and poetics; he imagines the multitudes of meanings we can extract from a single source, illuminating the rich possibility in ideas when they interact with our own experiences, and our own thoughts. Interpretation, and its generative potentialities, produces a relationship between the text and its critic, such that the text is the host and the critic feeds from it, producing new understandings that exceed the original.</p>

<p>These relationships of hosting, coexistence, cohabitation and solidarity, describe the human and non-human entities that sustain life. In our bodies, we host parasites and friends, vast empires of bacteria (Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, etc.) that live in the body, millions and millions of organisms lining the slippery, sinewy linings of my intestines. They help digest food, but they also touch almost everything else. Pertinently, most of the body’s serotonin is found in the gastrointestinal tract, produced in the intestines (with the help of the microbiome) and dispensed in the brain. Serotonin, along with oxytocin, endorphins, and dopamine, is popularly imagined as a happiness chemical, a reductionist summary that belies its complex and multi-faceted biological functions, which contributes to the regulation of digestion, bowel movements, nausea, along with mood, sustained energy, and balanced sex drive.</p>
                
<p>When antibiotics wipe out gut microbiota, it leads to a physical condition called dysbiosis: a state of microfloral imbalance. Dysbiosis, in turn, is associated (whether causal or resultant, as of yet undetermined) with inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders, metabolic syndrome, and any number of affected functions on the brain-gut axis. In dysbiotic systems, everything goes into shock: serotonin production is wiped out, normal digestion is knocked off track, there is a cascade of physical reactions to a violent disruption in the body. See: depression, self-harm, suicidality.</p>
        
<p>Disruption happens everywhere in the natural world. Timothy Morton refers to this process of disconnection from our environment as “the severing,” David Abram refers to it as a “dislocation” with the earth, Robin Wall Kimmerer refers to this process as “distancing.” Perhaps they all refer to the same division between the false binaries we’ve created to better order the world: inside / outside, human / nature, private / public, yours / mine, matter / mind, real / imagined.  Post-humanism, ecological philosophy, feminist theory and indigenous epistemologies offer seemingly limitless understandings through which we can revisit our preconceived understandings of the world and access new ways of seeing and knowing. Scholars, activists, thinkers, artists are demanding we disassemble anthropocentric structures that dominate human understandings of the world, and the the definitional binaries that pervade them. Abram writes about it in the physical sense, “both the perceiving being and the perceived are of the same stuff, … in some sense even reversible aspects of a common animate element, or Flesh, that is at once both sensible and sensitive” (1996, 67). Disruption is a destructive force because it disturbs and shatters and separates, sometimes offering a chaotic disassemblage of moving parts (disaster), and at other times, offering a path towards new futures, reimagining, unions.</p>

                Sample Policy Recommendation for NYC's Department of Transportation

                <p>In 2017, increased media attention revealed the extent of disarray in New York City’s subways, elevating the voices of concerned New Yorkers about the city’s most important public transit system and illustrating the essential role that the subways have in ensuring that NYC remains vibrant and accessible (Fessenden 2017; Mahler 2018). In 2016, transit dysfunction cost NYC’s economy an estimated $307 million, cost individual New Yorkers their time—and in some cases, their jobs—compounding pessimistic attitudes towards the agencies that oversee the subways (Fitzsimmons 2017; IBO 2017).</p>

                <p>In NYC, the deterioration of the subway poses an existential threat to “the city that the subways built,” given the ways in which the rail systems historically and currently facilitate economic, political and cultural integration (Mahler 2018; Lefebvre 1968). Even as 5.66 million people use the subway everyday, experts suggest that it is precisely this high level of utilization, accompanied by decades of funding cuts, that threaten the system’s future and exacerbate its current infrastructural failures (Fessenden 2017; Rosenthal, Fitzsimmons, LaForgia 2017). In search of reliable transit, many New Yorkers are choosing ride-share services and personal vehicles to reach their destinations—both of which may detract from public transit revenue and worsen congestion (Santora 2017). A report by INRIX, a traffic analytics firm, ranked NYC the second most congested city in the US, tallying economic losses of $16.9 billion per year for the city as a whole, contributing to degraded air quality and straining road infrastructure (Cookson and Pishue 2017; Falcocchio and Levinson 2015).</p>
                <p>
                It is imperative that New York City repair and improve its subways—however, a comprehensive subway transformation, detailed in the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA)’s plans, could cost $9 billion and would undoubtedly exacerbate existing delays (MTA 2017; RPA 2017). To accommodate existing and projected operational lags, NYC’s Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) and the MTA, should further expand NYC’s Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT), known as the Select Bus Service (SBS), to supplement regular subway traffic. </p>
                <p>
                Existing SBS routes have been shown to reduce average commute time by 20 percent, and given that these systems operate with high demand, suggests that expanded service would see corresponding increases in ridership (GAO 2012; NYCDOT 2014). In a survey, SBS riders confirmed that they preferred SBS over local service, and that ⅔ of riders took it regularly as part of their commute because of its reliable and rapid service (Wan 2016). Recognizing their success, the NYCDOT authored a report last year which illustrated the SBS’s achievements and included plans to dedicate $9.4 million to its expansion (NYCDOT 2017 a).</p>
                <p>
                According to the BRT standards designated by the Institute for Transportation & Development Policy’s ‘Scorecard,’ NYC’s SBS is rated as a “light” BRT system, because it incorporates some, but not all, of the features of a conventional BRT system (ITDP 2016; McDonnell and Zellner 2011). Experts have observed that BRT systems in American cities often fall short of reaching their full potential because of local political pressure to preserve roads for private vehicles (Weinstock 2011). A series of targeted recommendations could make the SBS faster, more reliable and, critically, ease pressure on subways undergoing construction.
                </p>
                <p>
                Bus Lanes: Currently, NYC has 108 miles of dedicated bus lanes, but the SBS fleet is often delayed by obstacles in dedicated bus lanes because they are mixed-use (NYCDOT 2017 a). This could be addressed with more thorough traffic enforcement during peak hours, higher fines for blocking buses, and greater transit signal priority (NYCDOT 2017 b). The city should also consider designating fully dedicated bus lanes for the busiest routes, especially during subway construction (RPA 2017). 
                </p>
                <p>
                Priority on East River Bridges: Another proposal that deserves serious consideration is the extension of SBS corridors over more bridges and implementation of congestion pricing as a way to clear bus routes. Given traffic priority, buses could offer similarly convenient and efficient routes into Manhattan currently provided by subways (RPA 2017; Schwartz 2008; Schaller 2010). 
                </p>
                <p>
                SBS Shuttle Services: In DOT’s 2017 report, they determined that it would be “inefficient to duplicate subway routes.” However, this does not account for the fact that subway service is currently overburdened, which creates major delays and reduces capacity; the Lexington Avenue 6 line cancels an average 14 percent of all scheduled trips during peak hour (Fessenden 2017). If commuters were given a feasible alternative, and rush-hour BRT systems operated similarly to how a shuttle service does in high-density areas, it would ease pressure on both transit systems (GAO 2012).</p>
                <p>
                BRT systems cost significantly less than the projected budget to repair the subway and offer a more immediate plan to expand public transit during subway construction (Hensher and Golob 2008). As buses already provide strategic public transit in otherwise underserved areas, SBS enhancements offer an especially equitable option (PlaNYC 2007; PlaNYC 2014). Neighborhoods with access to high-speed public transit may also experience positive economic development and potentially ease pressure on the housing market in areas comparatively better served by subways (Davis 2013). </p>
                <p>
                There are drawbacks to expanding NYC’s SBS using these recommendations. Investments in BRT are vital now, but could prove less crucial after subway repairs, thus rendering certain infrastructural investments unnecessary. There is also a consideration of the timeline, recognizing that while initial capital costs for BRT implementation are lower, operating costs remain high because vehicle maintenance and driver labor require more resources (Hensher and Golob 2008). Additionally, there has historically been resistance from private vehicle owners and city residents to proposals that would commit street space to permanently dedicated bus lanes, implement congestion pricing or reduce available parking (West 2017).</p>
                <p>
                The NYCDOT’s latest SBS report, “Bus Forward,” details extensive plans to expand service, thereby linking more neighborhoods through multi-modal transit, and investing in steps to make SBS more effective. This proposal suggests that the SBS should work in tandem with the subway’s current limitations, building an integrated and adaptive system. Ultimately, the enhancement of SBS would serve as a critical resource in the endeavor to make NYC’s many public transit options more flexible and viable.</p>

<br/><br/>
            is it not poetry : when the clouds part and my legs follow,<br/>

            not poetry in its absolution ? you shrug me off and I am :<br/>
            adrift as ever, recording bird songs on my cassette<br/>
            living simply, giving everything away again,<br/>
            taking a drag of a cigarette that could be my last<br/>
            my lips the shade of lifted drug store cherry balm

            it must be poetry : to language destiny, to language fate, <br/>

            to mourn the longest day and the shortest day alike,<br/>
            my grandmother, the rosary, myself
<br/><br/>
            to me, it is : the knots in your back, arranged<br/>
            asymmetrically, by a lifetime I haven’t known, <br/>
            lifting ladders, painting canvas,<br/>
            bending over motorcycles, foreign cars, or<br/>
            under the weight of it all<br/>
            and, just now, making love to me
<br/><br/>
            this, this is poetry : I pull the petals off the flowers<br/>
            dust my cheeks with haloed chance<br/>
            chew on the possibility<br/>
            and surrender to providence<br/>
            there is beauty everywhere
