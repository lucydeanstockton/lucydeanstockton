                <p>
<p>I’m a freelance copywriter and journalist with a science background, a creative voice and communications expertise for nonprofits and research organizations. I’ve worked as a communications lead for a behavioral science consulting firm, as a music writer, a farmer and an educator. I have a highly versatile writing skillset, and balance engaging copy with insightful analysis. 
  </p>
    
   <p>I’ve written social media copy, blog content, marketing materials, B2B and B2C communication materials, and pursued promotional opportunities for guest posts and podcasts, with an organic public relations approach. Whether working independently or on a team, I’m an excellent communicator and a resourceful thinker, willing to ensure that any final product is exceptional.</p>
                 <p>
   <h3>Irrational Labs</h3>
   <p>In my work at <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/">Irrational Labs</a>, a behavioral design consulting firm, I’m responsible for growing our social media presence, writing biweekly newsletters, writing press releases, academic summaries, and copy editing website content. I employ SEO guidelines, targeted advertising and organic content to promote our workshops, bootcamps and thought leadership.</p> 
     
     <p>I ensure a cohesive, insightful, and playful, voice across all copy, catered to Irrational Labs’s audience of tech professionals, product managers, behavioral science academics and everyday consumers.</p>
   <h3>577 Records</h3>
   <p>I write <a href="https://www.577records.com/">577 Records</a>'s public-facing content, including drafting, editing and publishing to their website. I’ve employed both SEO and elevated music writing to develop a brand voice for their unique experimental jazz projects. In my writing, I've worked to highlight the aesthetic scope of their new projects, and their impressive roster of musicians, while situating them within the genre’s rich history.</p>
