                Sample Policy Recommendation for NYC's Department of Transportation

                <p>In 2017, increased media attention revealed the extent of disarray in New York City’s subways, elevating the voices of concerned New Yorkers about the city’s most important public transit system and illustrating the essential role that the subways have in ensuring that NYC remains vibrant and accessible (Fessenden 2017; Mahler 2018). In 2016, transit dysfunction cost NYC’s economy an estimated $307 million, cost individual New Yorkers their time—and in some cases, their jobs—compounding pessimistic attitudes towards the agencies that oversee the subways (Fitzsimmons 2017; IBO 2017).</p>

                <p>In NYC, the deterioration of the subway poses an existential threat to “the city that the subways built,” given the ways in which the rail systems historically and currently facilitate economic, political and cultural integration (Mahler 2018; Lefebvre 1968). Even as 5.66 million people use the subway everyday, experts suggest that it is precisely this high level of utilization, accompanied by decades of funding cuts, that threaten the system’s future and exacerbate its current infrastructural failures (Fessenden 2017; Rosenthal, Fitzsimmons, LaForgia 2017). In search of reliable transit, many New Yorkers are choosing ride-share services and personal vehicles to reach their destinations—both of which may detract from public transit revenue and worsen congestion (Santora 2017). A report by INRIX, a traffic analytics firm, ranked NYC the second most congested city in the US, tallying economic losses of $16.9 billion per year for the city as a whole, contributing to degraded air quality and straining road infrastructure (Cookson and Pishue 2017; Falcocchio and Levinson 2015).</p>
                <p>
                It is imperative that New York City repair and improve its subways—however, a comprehensive subway transformation, detailed in the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA)’s plans, could cost $9 billion and would undoubtedly exacerbate existing delays (MTA 2017; RPA 2017). To accommodate existing and projected operational lags, NYC’s Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) and the MTA, should further expand NYC’s Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT), known as the Select Bus Service (SBS), to supplement regular subway traffic. </p>
                <p>
                Existing SBS routes have been shown to reduce average commute time by 20 percent, and given that these systems operate with high demand, suggests that expanded service would see corresponding increases in ridership (GAO 2012; NYCDOT 2014). In a survey, SBS riders confirmed that they preferred SBS over local service, and that ⅔ of riders took it regularly as part of their commute because of its reliable and rapid service (Wan 2016). Recognizing their success, the NYCDOT authored a report last year which illustrated the SBS’s achievements and included plans to dedicate $9.4 million to its expansion (NYCDOT 2017 a).</p>
                <p>
                According to the BRT standards designated by the Institute for Transportation & Development Policy’s ‘Scorecard,’ NYC’s SBS is rated as a “light” BRT system, because it incorporates some, but not all, of the features of a conventional BRT system (ITDP 2016; McDonnell and Zellner 2011). Experts have observed that BRT systems in American cities often fall short of reaching their full potential because of local political pressure to preserve roads for private vehicles (Weinstock 2011). A series of targeted recommendations could make the SBS faster, more reliable and, critically, ease pressure on subways undergoing construction.
                </p>
                <p>
                Bus Lanes: Currently, NYC has 108 miles of dedicated bus lanes, but the SBS fleet is often delayed by obstacles in dedicated bus lanes because they are mixed-use (NYCDOT 2017 a). This could be addressed with more thorough traffic enforcement during peak hours, higher fines for blocking buses, and greater transit signal priority (NYCDOT 2017 b). The city should also consider designating fully dedicated bus lanes for the busiest routes, especially during subway construction (RPA 2017). 
                </p>
                <p>
                Priority on East River Bridges: Another proposal that deserves serious consideration is the extension of SBS corridors over more bridges and implementation of congestion pricing as a way to clear bus routes. Given traffic priority, buses could offer similarly convenient and efficient routes into Manhattan currently provided by subways (RPA 2017; Schwartz 2008; Schaller 2010). 
                </p>
                <p>
                SBS Shuttle Services: In DOT’s 2017 report, they determined that it would be “inefficient to duplicate subway routes.” However, this does not account for the fact that subway service is currently overburdened, which creates major delays and reduces capacity; the Lexington Avenue 6 line cancels an average 14 percent of all scheduled trips during peak hour (Fessenden 2017). If commuters were given a feasible alternative, and rush-hour BRT systems operated similarly to how a shuttle service does in high-density areas, it would ease pressure on both transit systems (GAO 2012).</p>
                <p>
                BRT systems cost significantly less than the projected budget to repair the subway and offer a more immediate plan to expand public transit during subway construction (Hensher and Golob 2008). As buses already provide strategic public transit in otherwise underserved areas, SBS enhancements offer an especially equitable option (PlaNYC 2007; PlaNYC 2014). Neighborhoods with access to high-speed public transit may also experience positive economic development and potentially ease pressure on the housing market in areas comparatively better served by subways (Davis 2013). </p>
                <p>
                There are drawbacks to expanding NYC’s SBS using these recommendations. Investments in BRT are vital now, but could prove less crucial after subway repairs, thus rendering certain infrastructural investments unnecessary. There is also a consideration of the timeline, recognizing that while initial capital costs for BRT implementation are lower, operating costs remain high because vehicle maintenance and driver labor require more resources (Hensher and Golob 2008). Additionally, there has historically been resistance from private vehicle owners and city residents to proposals that would commit street space to permanently dedicated bus lanes, implement congestion pricing or reduce available parking (West 2017).</p>
                <p>
                The NYCDOT’s latest SBS report, “Bus Forward,” details extensive plans to expand service, thereby linking more neighborhoods through multi-modal transit, and investing in steps to make SBS more effective. This proposal suggests that the SBS should work in tandem with the subway’s current limitations, building an integrated and adaptive system. Ultimately, the enhancement of SBS would serve as a critical resource in the endeavor to make NYC’s many public transit options more flexible and viable.</p>

        <h1>poetry</h1>
            is it not poetry : my fingers clumsy on the keyboard ?
       <br/>
            or : my feet heavy on concrete,
            every step a promise ?
            <br/>
            is it not poetry : when the clouds part and my legs follow,
            <br/>
            when I jump the lines on the crosswalk
            and see sunset rising in the glass ?
<br/>
            not poetry in its disintegration ? I disagree, or I hope :
            things fall apart like I do
<br/>
            not poetry in its absolution ? you shrug me off and I am :
            adrift as ever, recording bird songs on my cassette
            living simply, giving everything away again,
            taking a drag of a cigarette that could be my last
            my lips the shade of lifted drug store cherry balm
<br/>
            it must be poetry : to language destiny, to language fate, 
            to whisper at the beginning of time
            to gesture towards the end of the world
<br/>
            maybe it’s poetry : to know my pain
            cradled in my palms, radiating through my nerves
            to mourn the longest day and the shortest day alike,
            my grandmother, the rosary, myself
<br/>
            to me, it is : the knots in your back, arranged
            asymmetrically, by a lifetime I haven’t known, 
            lifting ladders, painting canvas,
            bending over motorcycles, foreign cars, or
            under the weight of it all
            and, just now, making love to me
<br/>
            this, this is poetry : I pull the petals off the flowers
            dust my cheeks with haloed chance
            chew on the possibility
            and surrender to providence
            there is beauty everywhere
<br/>
            and I’ll know poetry : when it knows me
